The reason for the circuit to be valid for all kinds of numbers is beacuse we are converting each string to its 
binary representation. The quantum circuit is utilised only when both the numbers are positive or negative. The first case where both numbers have 
different signs is handled classically. For the case where both numbers have the same sign we are performing a Quantum Bit String Comparator circuit 
and performing a full subtraction. Each loop of the circuit has 4 qubits to it. One for each carryin, number 1, number 2 and carryout.
